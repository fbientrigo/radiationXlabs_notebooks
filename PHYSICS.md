You are an experimental radiation physicist preparing a CHARM mixed-field campaign. Compile a rigorous derivation of latch-up rate predictions for FPGA/CPLD boards, starting from flux spectra \(\Phi(t, E)\) and energy-dependent cross-sections \(\sigma(E)\). Include:
1. Governing equations for expected event counts, variance, and confidence intervals under both stationary and time-varying flux.
2. Calibration workflows for verDAQ voltage probes, DMM current monitors, and bitflip counters, including uncertainty budgets.
3. Benchmark values or published data sets relevant to mixed proton/neutron fields impacting digital electronics.
Conclude with an itemized checklist of laboratory steps to validate the model before beam time.

Act as a statistical physicist specializing in rare-event inference. Given asynchronous telemetry streams (voltage, current, bitflips, beam monitors), design Bayesian and frequentist pipelines to infer the latent beam intensity profile and device susceptibility parameters. Detail:
1. Likelihood formulations accommodating censored or missing data segments.
2. Change-point detection strategies that remain robust when sampling cadences drift.
3. Posterior diagnostic techniques and computational shortcuts suited for notebook-scale analyses.
Provide pseudocode templates and references to foundational papers.

You are an embedded reliability engineer tasked with translating physics insights into actionable safeguards. Investigate latch-up mitigation and recovery strategies for high-density FPGAs under mixed-field exposure. Report on:
1. Hardware design patterns (e.g., current limiting, watchdog resets) and their quantitative impact on downtime.
2. Firmware/software interventions for predictive alerting using risk scores derived from radiation models.
3. Industry case studies where similar architectures were qualified for space or HEP environments, highlighting test conditions and outcomes.
Finish with decision matrices that map predicted risk levels to recommended operational responses.

As a computational scientist, survey algorithms and data structures best suited to implement the LeetCode-style formulation described in README.md. Focus on:
1. Efficient multi-stream synchronization (interval trees, Fenwick trees, segment trees) with code sketches.
2. Anomaly scoring methods combining sliding windows, Bayesian online change-point detection, and ensemble techniques.
3. Approaches for integrating predictions into interactive dashboards, noting performance considerations for large notebooks.
