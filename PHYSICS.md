Latch-Up Rate Prediction for FPGA/CPLD Boards in Mixed-Field Radiation
Overview: In a mixed-field radiation test (such as CERN’s CHARM facility), we predict the rate of single-event latch-ups (SELs) in a digital board by combining the particle flux spectrum and the device’s energy-dependent latch-up cross-section. The device under test is a Lattice MachXO3D-9400 FPGA (marketed as a “CPLD”), a 19×19 mm BGA with 484 pins. The CHARM environment provides a broad energy range of radiation – from thermal neutrons (<1 eV) up to GeV-scale hadrons produced by a 24 GeV proton beam
r2e.web.cern.ch
. We derive the governing equations for expected latch-up counts, include statistical confidence estimations, outline calibration of measurement instruments (voltage probes, current monitors, bit-flip counters) with uncertainty budgets, and provide benchmark data from literature. Finally, a checklist of pre-beam laboratory steps is given to validate the prediction model.
Derivation of Latch-Up Event Rate from Flux and Cross-Section
Flux Spectrum and Cross-Section Definitions: Let $\Phi(t,E)$ be the differential particle flux (particles per cm² per second per unit energy) incident on the device at time $t$ and energy $E$. Let $\sigma(E)$ be the latch-up cross-section of the device (in cm²) as a function of particle energy. The cross-section represents the effective area presented for a latch-up event – equivalently, $\sigma(E)$ is the probability of SEL per particle fluence, scaled by unit area
[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/6/11/119#:~:text=used%2C%20as%20their%20nuclear%20cross,1)
. A higher $\sigma$ means the device is more susceptible at that energy. Instantaneous Event Rate: At a given time $t$, the rate of latch-up events (per second) is:
$R(t) \;=\; \int_{E_{\min}}^{E_{\max}} \Phi(t,E)\,\sigma(E)\,dE\,,$

ntegrating over the relevant energy range of the mixed field. This “folds” the flux spectrum with the device response
[mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-4310/6/11/119#:~:text=used%2C%20as%20their%20nuclear%20cross,1)
. In a mixed field like CHARM, $\Phi(t,E)$ includes contributions from many particle types (protons, neutrons, pions, etc.), but the integral effectively sums all contributions. (In practice one might sum separate integrals for each particle type if $\sigma(E)$ differs by particle, but SEL cross-sections are often treated as primarily dependent on deposited energy/LET rather than particle species.) Expected Counts for Stationary Flux: If the flux spectrum is steady (stationary) over time – i.e. $\Phi(t,E) = \Phi(E)$ constant in time – the expected number of latch-up events in a run of duration $T$ is:
$\mu \;=\; T \;\int \Phi(E)\,\sigma(E)\,dE \,.$

his can be understood as flux $\times$ cross-section $\times$ time, integrated over energy. For example, if one uses the “high-energy hadron” flux (HEH, number of hadrons >20 MeV per cm²·s) as a simplified measure
r2e.web.cern.ch
, and if a device’s latch-up cross-section for E>20 MeV is known or assumed, then $\mu \approx \text{HEH flux} \times \sigma_{\text{eff}} \times T$
mdpi.com
. (This is a common approximation when detailed energy dependence is unknown: one uses an effective cross-section at a reference energy, e.g. 200 MeV, times the integrated >20 MeV fluence
mdpi.com
.) Time-Varying Flux: If the flux varies with time – for instance, pulsed beam spills or changing beam intensity – one must integrate over time as well. The total expected count is obtained by integrating the instantaneous rate:
$\mu \;=\; \int_{0}^{T} R(t)\,dt \;=\; \int_{0}^{T}\!\!\int \Phi(t,E)\,\sigma(E)\,dE\,dt \,.$
By Fubini’s theorem we can swap integrals and also express $\mu = \int \Sigma(E),dE$, where $\Sigma(E) = \int_0^T \Phi(t,E)dt$ is the fluence spectrum (particles/cm² in energy bin $E$ over the whole test). In other words, the total expected latch-up count depends only on the total fluence spectrum delivered. This is equivalent to summing contributions from each time interval or each energy bin. For example, if the beam is on for 5 days at a roughly constant intensity, one can sum the fluence of each spill; if the beam intensity increases or decreases, one integrates accordingly – the final $\mu$ will be the same as if all fluence were delivered steadily over $T$. Multiple Particle Species: In a mixed field, it’s often convenient to break the integral into a sum over particle species $i$ (protons, neutrons, pions, etc.): $\mu = \sum_i \int \Phi_i(E),\sigma_i(E),dE$. If the latch-up mechanism is purely energy deposition in silicon, $\sigma_i(E)$ might be similar for particles that produce similar secondary ionization. However, certain particles can be more effective; for instance, pions have been observed to induce SEEs at a higher rate around certain energies due to a nuclear resonance

. In general, one uses the appropriate $\sigma$ for each particle (often measured experimentally for protons or neutrons) or an empirical fit (e.g. a Weibull curve covering all hadrons). If only a mono-energetic test (like 200 MeV protons) is available, one might assume that cross-section for all high-energy hadrons as a conservative estimate
mdpi.com
. Units Check: It’s important to keep units consistent. $\Phi$ typically has units of [cm⁻²·s⁻¹·(MeV)⁻¹] if differential, or [cm⁻²·s⁻¹] if already integrated over energy (like HEH flux). $\sigma$ is in [cm²] per device. Thus $\Phi \times \sigma$ has units [s⁻¹], and multiplying by time gives an expected count (dimensionless). If using a fluence (cm⁻²) for a given energy range, multiplying by $\sigma$ (cm²) yields an expectation (since cm⁻²·cm² cancels). For example, if $10^9$ hadrons/cm² (above 20 MeV) are delivered, and $\sigma_{\text{SEL}}$ = $10^{-12}$ cm², the expected latch-up count is $10^9 \times 10^{-12} = 10^{-3}$ – i.e. a 0.1% chance of one latch-up.
## Statistical Expectation, Variance, and Confidence Intervals
Poisson Statistics for Rare Events: Latch-up occurrences are typically rare and statistically independent, so the number of latch-ups $N$ in a run is well modeled by a Poisson process. The Poisson mean $\lambda$ is the expected value $\mu$ calculated above. The probability of observing $k$ latch-ups is $P(N=k) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^k}{k!}$. Key properties of a Poisson distribution are $E[N]=\lambda$ and $\mathrm{Var}(N)=\lambda$. Thus, the variance in the latch-up count equals the expected count. If $\mu$ is small (much less than 1), there’s a high chance of seeing zero events; if $\mu$ is large, actual counts will statistically fluctuate around $\mu$ with standard deviation $\sqrt{\mu}$. Stationary vs Time-Varying Flux: A time-varying flux (non-homogeneous Poisson process) still yields a Poisson-distributed total count, as long as the rate $R(t)$ is known and events are independent. In fact, for a non-homogeneous Poisson process with mean $\lambda = \int_0^T R(t)dt$, the total $N$ in time $T$ is Poisson($\lambda$) and retains $E[N]=\lambda$, $\mathrm{Var}(N)=\lambda$. The time-variation can affect when events tend to occur (clustering during high-intensity periods), but not the overall count distribution. One must ensure that the assumption of independent events holds; at extremely high instantaneous flux, multiple simultaneous strikes could produce compounding effects (but in practice SEL events are constrained by needing a single sensitive region to be triggered, and modern devices often handle high flux without simultaneous multiple SELs). Confidence Intervals: Because $N$ is discrete and often small, confidence intervals for the true mean (or for the predicted count) should be derived from Poisson statistics rather than normal approximations when counts are low. For example, if the prediction is $\mu = 1$ latch-up on average, there is a 37% chance of zero events (since $P(0)=e^{-1}$) and a 37% chance of one event, etc. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the true mean given an observed count $k$ can be obtained by solving the Poisson cumulative distribution: for instance, observing $k=0$ events in a test gives an upper 95% CI on $\lambda$ of about 3.0 (since $P(N=0)=e^{-\lambda}$, setting $e^{-\lambda}=0.05$ yields $\lambda\approx3$). Similarly, observing 1 event yields a very uncertain estimate: the 95% CI for $\lambda$ ranges roughly from 0.085 up to 8.7 (in units of events per test)
cds.cern.ch
. For example: one proton irradiation of an FPGA observed 1 latch-up at a fluence of $5.9\times10^{11}$ protons/cm², which corresponds to a nominal cross-section of $\approx1.7\times10^{-12}$ cm²/device. However, with one event the 95% CI for the cross-section was broad: $8.5\times10^{-14}$ to $8.7\times10^{-12}$ cm²/device
cds.cern.ch
. This illustrates that a single observed event leaves an order-of-magnitude uncertainty. Conversely, if zero latch-ups are seen up to a fluence $\Phi_{\text{tot}}$, one can quote an upper bound on $\sigma$ (or on $\mu$) at a given confidence. Using the 95% criterion, $\sigma_{\text{upper}} \approx \frac{3}{\Phi_{\text{tot}}}$ (since $\lambda = \Phi_{\text{tot}}\sigma$ would be ~3 for 95% upper limit when 0 events). In practice, test reports often give such upper limits. For instance, in a recent neutron test of a 28 nm FPGA, no latch-ups were observed up to $1.16\times10^{12}$ n/cm², translating to an upper cross-section limit of $\sim8.6\times10^{-13}$ cm²/device at 95% confidence
ww1.microchip.com
. Variance and Margin in Planning: When planning a beam test, you might compute $\mu$ to be, say, 0.5 latch-ups expected in the week. The variance is also 0.5, so the standard deviation is $\sqrt{0.5}\approx0.7$ – comparable to the mean itself. This means there is a significant chance of seeing either 0 or 1 events (in fact $P(0)=e^{-0.5}\approx60%$, $P(1)=30%$, $P(\ge2)=10%$). If it’s important to detect a latch-up, one might need a higher fluence (higher $\mu$) to reduce the risk of a zero-count outcome. On the other hand, if $\mu$ is large (e.g. 10 latch-ups expected), one can estimate roughly $\pm\sqrt{10}\approx\pm3$ variation (one standard deviation). But for formal error bars or high confidence levels, it’s better to use the Poisson cumulative distribution as described. In summary, the confidence interval for $N$ given a predicted $\mu$ can be expressed using the incomplete gamma function (Poisson quantiles), but often it’s sufficient to state the expected value and note the Poisson variability in terms of $\sqrt{\mu}$ or the 95% bounds as above.
## Calibration of Probesa
Accurate measurements during the irradiation require calibrating all monitoring instruments and accounting for their uncertainties. The primary instruments in this setup include verDAQ voltage probes (for supply or node voltages), digital multimeter (DMM) based current monitors (for supply current to detect latch-up spikes), and on-board bit-flip counters (to log memory SEUs). Below we describe the calibration workflow for each and outline their uncertainty budgets.
verDAQ Voltage Probe Calibration: The verDAQ system is a versatile DAQ with analog voltage channels. Calibrate each voltage probe by applying known reference voltages across the expected measurement range (e.g. 0 V, 1.2 V, 3.3 V if those correspond to monitored rails). Use a precision voltage source or a high-accuracy DMM as a reference to verify the reading. Perform a two-point (offset and gain) calibration: adjust or record the offset (output at 0 V input) and scale (e.g. at a full-scale input) to ensure the probe + ADC combination reads correctly. If the probes have attenuation or amplification, include that in the calibration (for example, a 10× probe factor). Uncertainty budget: consider the reference uncertainty (the accuracy of the calibrator or DMM, typically on the order of 0.01–0.1%), the ADC resolution and quantization error (e.g. an 12-bit or 16-bit ADC over the voltage span – quantization might be a few mV), any offset drift or noise. For instance, zero the probe input to measure any baseline offset noise. After calibration, the voltage measurement uncertainty might be, say, ±(0.5% of reading + 5 mV) depending on the probe characteristics. Ensure to perform this calibration at least at room temperature; if the test will see varying temperature, consider the temperature coefficient of the probe/ADC (include a margin if needed). In summary, document the total uncertainty (e.g. combine calibration error, linearity, and noise). This is important for detecting, for example, a 5% drop in supply voltage (due to radiation damage or a latch-up event) with confidence.
DMM Current Monitor Calibration: The supply current to the DUT is monitored via a DMM (which could be a high-precision digital multimeter or a dedicated current sensor hooked into a DAQ). First, choose an appropriate current range or shunt resistor so that the nominal operating current is well within range and a latch-up surge (which might be several times nominal) will saturate or trigger an alert. Calibrate the current readout by injecting a known current: for example, use a precision current source or a calibrated resistor in series with a power supply. One method is to pass a known DC current (e.g. 50 mA, 100 mA, up to the expected latch-up level maybe 500 mA) through the DMM and verify the reading. If using an external shunt + voltmeter, calibrate the shunt value by measuring its resistance accurately and verifying the voltage-drop to current conversion. Uncertainty budget: The DMM’s specified accuracy (e.g. ±(0.05% + 50 µA) for a given range) is a primary component. Add the shunt tolerance (if 0.1% resistor) and any thermal drift (shunt heating at higher currents can change resistance slightly). Also consider the digitization or logging interval – for instance, if the DMM is sampling at 10 Hz, a very brief current spike might be missed. However, latch-ups typically persist until power is cycled, so the current stays high until detected. Verify the DMM’s response time or use a parallel fast analog comparator as a latch-up trigger if necessary. After calibration, determine the smallest current change that is reliably detectable (e.g. if nominal is 100 mA, and latch-up is 500 mA, ensure that a jump of that size is unmistakable given the noise and resolution). Typically, one might achieve ±1% or better accuracy on current. Ensuring this calibration means that when a latch-up occurs, the recorded current increase is quantitatively trustworthy (for later analysis of how “strong” the latch-up was, in terms of drawn current).
Bit-Flip Counter Validation: The FPGA board is likely instrumented with logic to count single-event upsets (bit flips) in memory or registers. This could be implemented by writing a known pattern to a block of memory (or shift registers) and periodically checking it for errors, or by using hardened sequential logic that increments a counter on detection of a flip. To calibrate or validate this system, inject known bit-flips and see if they are counted. For example, pre-load a memory and then intentionally flip a few bits via JTAG or an internal test mode to see if the counter increments appropriately. Alternatively, use a pseudo-random binary sequence and its error-detection to simulate an SEU. If possible, an ground-level test can be done by exposing the device to a small radioactive source (e.g. an alpha emitter or thermal neutron source with a Boron-rich material to induce soft errors) – the idea is to produce a few upsets in a controlled way to verify the logging. Ensure that the counter does not overflow during the test (choose a counter size sufficient for the expected number of bit flips, or implement periodic readout/reset). Uncertainty considerations: A digital counter’s count is exact for the flips it actually registers, so there is essentially no measurement error in the count itself – if every real bit-flip generates a count. The key uncertainty is detection efficiency. For instance, if the polling of memory is done at intervals, a bit could flip and then flip back before being noticed (though spontaneous double flips are extremely unlikely). Or if multiple bits flip between reads, all will be caught upon readout (since each will be a mismatch). In an FPGA design, one must ensure that the error-detection logic itself is robust against radiation (perhaps using triple modular redundancy or parity for the counter) – otherwise a latch-up or SEU in the counter could corrupt the count. We include a margin for the possibility of undetected errors: for example, specify that the counter is verified to catch >99% of single-bit errors. For the uncertainty budget, one might simply state a confidence in the bit-flip count (e.g. “±1 count” if any false counts are possible, or include an observation that no false counts occurred in ground testing). The bottom line is that the bit-flip counting mechanism should be tested end-to-end so we trust that a reported number of SEUs is accurate within a negligible error. This ensures that later, when correlating bit-flip counts to expected cross-sections, the data is valid.

## Benchmark Data for Mixed-Field Radiation Effects on Electronics

It’s useful to compare our predictions and device specifications with published radiation test data in similar environments. Below are several relevant benchmark values and data points from literature, focusing on proton/neutron mixed fields and their impact on digital electronics (both SEL and SEU outcomes):
CHARM Mixed-Field Energy Spectrum: The CHARM facility’s radiation covers a very broad energy range. For a copper target with no shielding (typical maximum stress configuration), the secondary particles include everything from thermal neutrons (<0.025 eV) up to high-energy hadrons of several GeV
r2e.web.cern.ch
. This range is significantly wider than most mono-energetic test beams. It implies that any energy-dependent effects (like certain resonances in cross-section vs energy) could be activated – for example, pions and protons in the 50–200 MeV range can cause specific enhanced SEE cross-sections in modern devices due to nuclear resonances
researchgate.net
. Our model must account for this full spectrum, typically by using energy-dependent $\sigma(E)$ or an equivalent method (such as Monte Carlo simulation of energy deposition in the device
mdpi.com
).
High-Energy Hadron (HEH) Flux to Dose Conversion: As a reference for intensity, at CHARM roughly $10^9$ hadrons/cm² (E > 20 MeV) impart about 1 Gy(Si) of dose in silicon
r2e.web.cern.ch
. Likewise, 1 HEH/cm² is approximately $4$ neq/cm² (where neq is 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence for displacement damage)
r2e.web.cern.ch
. This means a week-long run delivering, say, $10^{10}$ hadrons/cm² corresponds to ~10 Gy total ionizing dose in the device. It’s a useful benchmark to ensure our test does not inadvertently exceed dose limits or to interpret any cumulative dose effects (e.g. parametric shifts). The given MachXO3D device is likely robust to at least a few tens of Gy, but this conversion highlights the mixed-field intensity: a week at CHARM can simulate several years of LHC tunnel exposure in terms of fluence and dose (the LHC average dose rate is on the order of $10^{-7}$ Gy/s
r2e.web.cern.ch
, so one week at CHARM [5 days beam-on] can equal many years of that environment).
SEL Cross-Section (Proton Beam Example): In a dedicated proton-beam test of a Xilinx FPGA (for the ATLAS detector electronics), a latch-up was observed at 105 MeV proton energy with a fluence of $5.9\times10^{11}$ cm⁻². This yielded a measured SEL cross-section ~1.7×10⁻¹² cm²/device
cds.cern.ch
. At lower energies (e.g. 20–100 MeV), no latch-ups occurred in that test, implying the cross-section at those energies was below ~$10^{-12}$ cm²/device (within the fluence limits tested)
cds.cern.ch
. This example shows that SELs are extremely rare in modern FPGAs under proton irradiation – on the order of one per 10^11–10^12 particles. It also underscores the energy threshold aspect: often SEL cross-section rises sharply above some energy (when particles can deposit enough LET to trigger a latch-up in silicon). In our MachXO3D (Lattice) device, we expect similarly low SEL probability. If our predicted $\mu$ comes out very small (<<1 in a week), that aligns with these literature values.
SEL in Spallation Neutron Fields: A study of SRAM memories at the ISIS spallation source (ChipIr beam up to ~800 MeV neutrons) reported latch-up cross-sections on the order of $10^{-10}$ cm² per device for two different SRAM chips
mdpi.com
. Specifically, $\sim7\times10^{-11}$ cm²/device was measured as the saturated SEL cross-section in a broad-spectrum neutron beam
mdpi.com
. This is higher than the proton-beam example above, likely because the devices had an intrinsic sensitivity (older technology or presence of high-$Z$ materials like tungsten that amplify high-energy interactions
cds.cern.ch
cds.cern.ch
). It demonstrates that in a mixed field (with high-energy neutrons producing secondary heavy ions internally), SEL can occur a bit more frequently. Our model should be flexible to accommodate such data – for instance by using a Weibull fit for $\sigma(E)$ that eventually plateaus around $10^{-10}$ cm² at high energies for devices with strong energy dependence
mdpi.com
. We will compare our MachXO3D predictions against these numbers to see if it’s more in line with the “very SEL-immune” FPGAs (~1e-12 cm² level) or if any architecture aspects might allow higher SEL probability.
SEU (Bit Flip) Rates in Mixed Fields: While the focus is latch-up, the board also monitors single-event upsets (SEUs). Published SEU cross-sections for modern FPGAs and memories provide context. For example, a Xilinx SRAM-based FPGA at 28 nm was found to have an SEU cross-section for configuration bits on the order of $10^{-14}$–$10^{-13}$ cm²/bit in the 10–100 MeV range
phenix.bnl.gov
. In one report, proton and neutron-induced SEU cross-sections were ~3.4×10⁻¹⁴ cm²/bit for protons (10–100 MeV) and ~3.4×10⁻¹⁴ cm²/bit for neutrons >10 MeV
phenix.bnl.gov
, i.e. comparable in that energy range. These correspond to device-level SEU rates in the order of FIT (failures in time) that are significant: for instance, if an FPGA has millions of bits, a fluence of $10^9$ cm⁻² could upset hundreds of bits (since $10^9 \times 10^{-14} = 10^{-5}$ upsets per bit, times 10^6 bits = 10^1, i.e. ~10 upsets). In accelerator terms, one often quotes SEU rates in FIT (failures per 10^9 hours). The MDPI study by Cecchetto et al. (2019) showed that neglecting energy dependence can under-predict SEE rates by up to a factor of 4 on ground and more at altitude
mdpi.com
mdpi.com
. For our test, the bit-flip counters will likely record dozens to thousands of SEUs over the week, given the intense mixed field – those results can be benchmarked against known values (e.g. if we see 1000 flips in 10^9 hadrons, that implies an average cross-section of 1e-12 per device or ~1e-16 per bit if 10^4 bits were sensitive, which is plausible). We will compare the observed SEU counts with literature to sanity-check the DUT’s behavior in the mixed field.
Total Ionizing Dose and Displacement Damage: Although not the main focus for a one-week run, it’s worth noting typical TID and DDD levels. The LHC tunnel average dose rate ~3.9×10⁻⁷ Gy/s (reference value)
r2e.web.cern.ch
, and CHARM can deliver that order of dose much faster. In one week, a component might accumulate ~10 Gy (depending on position and configuration). Lattice MachXO3D FPGAs are non-volatile (flash-based configuration), generally tolerant to some TID, but anecdotally flash FPGAs can show configuration upsets or parametric shifts around a few tens of Gy. We should keep an eye on any slowly rising supply current (from CMOS leakage increasing) or threshold shifts that might affect the logic, especially toward the end of the run. Displacement damage (neutron 1 MeV equivalent fluence) can also be assessed: CHARM’s conversion (1 HEH/cm² ≈ 4 neq/cm²)
r2e.web.cern.ch
 suggests that if we get, say, $10^9$ HEH/cm², that’s $4\times10^9$ neq/cm² – which is a substantial but not extreme level (some transistor gain degradation could occur, but likely not catastrophic for logic in a week). These effects are synergistic – for example, a device heavily damaged by dose might be more prone to latch-up due to increased leakage. However, for a short test we expect minimal synergy impact
r2e.web.cern.ch
.
## Pre-Beam Validation Checklist
Before heading into the beam time, it’s crucial to validate the prediction model and the experimental setup in the lab. Below is a checklist of laboratory steps to perform to ensure the latch-up rate model and measurement system are robust:
Review Device Design and Sensitive Volume: Confirm the MachXO3D-9400 FPGA’s technology details that influence latch-up susceptibility (e.g. fabrication node, presence of guard rings or epitaxial layer). Estimate the LET threshold for SEL from datasheets or similar devices. This informs the expected energy threshold for $\sigma(E)$ in the model.
Cross-Section Inputs Verification: If available, obtain any test data for the MachXO3 family (from vendor or literature) on radiation performance. In absence of device-specific data, validate that the assumed $\sigma(E)$ curve (or effective cross-section value) is reasonable by comparing against known FPGA SEL data (like the Xilinx and SRAM benchmarks above). Adjust the model’s cross-section vs energy (e.g. Weibull parameters) so that it would predict the literature-observed rates for those reference cases. This “calibrates” the model’s aggressiveness.
Dry-Run of Flux Integration: Using the expected CHARM spectral fluence (possibly provided by FLUKA simulations or facility data), perform a numerical integration offline (in a script or calculation) to compute the predicted latch-up count $\mu$. Do this for both the time-averaged flux and explicitly for the spill structure (if spills are 350 ms with $5\times10^{11}$ protons each, integrate over that pattern for 5 days). Ensure the time-integration code or calculation handles the non-uniform beam delivery correctly. Verify that the stationary approximation (average flux × time) gives nearly the same $\mu$ as the detailed time-dependent integration (they should agree to within a small fraction). This confirms the model implementation is consistent.
Statistical Analysis Preparation: Decide on the criteria for declaring a latch-up during the test (e.g. current exceeds X mA for >Y ms). Compute the threshold in terms of significance above noise (from calibration data). Then, before beam, use the model’s $\mu$ to set expectations: for example, if $\mu=0.2$, plan what actions to take if 0 or 1 latch-ups occur (since either is likely). Prepare the method to compute confidence intervals on the fly – e.g. if we see 0 events, we’ll use the 95% upper bound to update our cross-section estimate. Having this statistical plan in advance ensures we interpret results correctly during the test.
Instrument Calibration and System Checkout: Complete the calibration of verDAQ voltage probes and DMM current monitor as detailed above. After calibration, simulate a latch-up event in the lab: for instance, abruptly connect a resistor to draw a latch-up-level current from the DUT’s supply (or use a MOSFET to pulse an additional load). Verify that the DMM (or an automated system) indeed flags this as a latch-up (e.g. logs the current spike and triggers any protection circuitry). Check that the recorded data (voltage droop, current spike) are timestamped and of good quality. Also simulate an SEU burst: e.g. flip a bit in the DUT’s memory while the system is running to see that the bit-flip counter increments and the event is time-tagged. This full system functional test (with artificial events) will confirm that the data acquisition and logging will work when real radiation events occur.
Uncertainty Budget Review: Compile the uncertainties from all sources – flux (if any uncertainty in the provided spectra or beam intensity), cross-section (range of plausible $\sigma$ from literature), and measurement errors from instruments. Propagate these to see the impact on $\mu$. For example, if the flux could be ±10% and $\sigma$ ± factor of 2 (typical if only upper limits known), the $\mu$ range might be quite broad. This exercise is to make sure we understand how confident we are in the prediction. If the uncertainty range of $\mu$ is too wide (spanning, say, 0.1 to 2 latch-ups), be mentally prepared for that range of outcomes. This also feeds into decisions like how long to irradiate – if no event by mid-test, we might extend time to narrow the confidence.
Protective Measures Validation: Since SEL can potentially damage the device, ensure all protections are in place and tested. This includes the fuse or circuit breaker on the DUT power (as used in prior tests
cds.cern.ch
) – intentionally induce an over-current and confirm the fuse trips or power-cycle mechanism works. Also ensure that after a latch-up (or fuse trip), the FPGA can be reset or power-cycled (perhaps remotely, since manual access during the run is not possible). Practice the power-cycle procedure that will be used when a latch-up is detected, to minimize down-time during the beam. The goal is to limit any permanent damage and recover operation to continue the test if possible.
Baseline Data Collection: Before exposing to radiation, run the DUT in normal conditions for an extended period (hours to a day) to log baseline measurements: supply current stability, bit-flip count (should remain zero in absence of radiation), any drift in voltage readings, etc. This baseline will help distinguish radiation-induced changes from normal behavior. For instance, if the current slowly increases during beam, we compare it to any thermal drift observed in baseline. Also, perform a software/hardware reset test: ensure you can clear the error counters and that they restart from known state – useful if counters saturate or if we want to partition the run into intervals.
Finalize Experiment Logistics: Make a final checklist for beam time: ensure the clock synchronization for timestamping events is working (if using external time or facility timing signals). Ensure all cables, remote connections, and backup hardware (spares) are ready given CHARM’s constraints (no mid-week access, etc.)
r2e.web.cern.ch
r2e.web.cern.ch
. Verify the data acquisition PC or controller can run unattended for a week and has sufficient disk space for all logs (voltage/current trace data and SEU logs can be sizable over days). Have a plan for periodic health checks (perhaps remotely) to see if the DUT is still running and the instruments are alive. Essentially, do a full “dress rehearsal” of the experiment in the lab for a few hours, capturing data, to be confident everything will run smoothly when the beam is on.
By completing the above steps, we ensure that our latch-up rate predictions are as accurate as possible and that the measurement setup will reliably capture any SEL or SEU that occurs. This preparation maximizes the scientific return of the one-week mixed-field campaign and helps avoid surprises during the actual irradiation. With the model validated and the instrumentation calibrated, we will be ready to compare the observed latch-up events (if any) against the predictions and thereby assess the MachXO3D FPGA’s robustness in the CHARM environment.
